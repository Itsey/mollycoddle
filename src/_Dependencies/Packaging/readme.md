### Mollycoddle Command Line Linting Tool.

Mollycoddle lints directory structures and code structures, it does not lint code itself but the files and directories that contain the code. It is designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the code is structured correctly and that the directory structure is consistent.
