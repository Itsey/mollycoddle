### 🚼 Mollycoddle Command Line Linting Tool 🚼

Mollycoddle lints directory structures and code structures, it does not lint code itself but the files and directories that contain the code. It is designed to be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the code is structured correctly and that the directory structure is consistent.  

The tool uses a series of rules files to configure how the structure linting should take place and the rules files can be customised to suit your needs.  The default rules files enforce a simple directory structure so that the top level of the repository is consistent as well as a default structure for .net code.  Alternative rules can be built or configured to suit your needs.
